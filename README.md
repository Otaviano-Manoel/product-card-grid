### What I learned

In this project, I used the grid, understood better how the grid works, and was able to apply it effectively in this project.

### Continued development

I will continue with my studies of HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - 
I used W3Schools to clarify my doubts and I really liked their examples, which clarify how to use CSS properties.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - I'd like you to get to know MDN Web Docs, which helped me a lot in understanding HTML tags.
